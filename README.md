## üö¶ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18.x or later
- pnpm (recommended) or yarn

### Installation

1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pnpm install
   ```

### Development

## üåê HTTP Communication

The application communicates with embossing machines over HTTP:

1. **Local Mode**: Connect to a machine on your local network
2. **Web Mode**: Connect to a remote API endpoint

The admin settings panel allows you to configure:
- API endpoints (local and web URLs)
- Embossing parameters (speed, duration, depth)
- Advanced machine settings (acceleration, jerk, cooling time)

## üé® Design Creation

The application includes a drawing canvas that allows users to:

1. Create freehand drawings
2. Add text with various fonts
3. Use eraser and selection tools
4. Save designs for embossing

## üì± User Interface
